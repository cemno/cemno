### Hello there! 👋
I am Clemens and studying agricultural science 🚜 with a focus on digital agriculture 🖥️. Its a rapidly growing field with a lot of exciting new technologies being adopted!

### What i'm currently doing

I use GitHub mostly for working on modules with friends. This includes:

- Tree phenology analysis with R
- Measuring phenotypes in heterogenic environments


Check out my latest created [HTML file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cemno/DecisionAnalysis-uebungen/blob/master/RMarkdown/RMarkdown_test.html) from the Decision analysis modul last semester.
