### Hello there! 👋
I am Clemens and studying agricultural science 🚜 with a focus on digital agriculture 🖥️. Its a rapidly growing field with a lot of exiting new technologies being adopted!

## What i'm currently doing

I mostly use GitHub for working on modules with friends. This includes:

- Python for applied machine learning
- Decision analysis


Check out my latest created [HTML file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cemno/DecisionAnalysis-uebungen/blob/master/RMarkdown/RMarkdown_test.html) from the Decision analysis modul.
